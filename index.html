                        There's a whole bunch of APIs that have come up, this isn't a complete list either. Some are already very widespread, think Geolocation, others not at all. I've never seen WebBluetooth in the wild yet for example, but it sounds like fun. WebNFC is on the list of things to come.<br />
                        All the apps on the FirefoxOS phones are written using these APIs, and so they let you do most things a phone can. You could theoretically write your own dialer using the WebTelephony app for example.<br />
                        We'll look at a few fun ones to give you some ideas of how you can extend your existing app easily.

                        Ambient Light is a w3c working draft. It adds an event on the window object, which gets called with the lux value the ambient light sensor measured.<br />
                        This is really straightforward, but allows cool things like allowing you to change the style and the contrast of your site/app based on the ambient light.

                        This one used to be called <em>WebVibrator</em>, that was changed to <em>Vibration API</em> after all the bad jokes had been made too many times.<br />
                        The Vibration API is simple as well, it allows you to call a function on the navigator object and either pass it a length it should vibrate (in milliseconds) or an array, where it'll switch between vibrating and not vibrating. So in the bottom example, it'd vibrate for 0.2 seconds, pause for 0.1 seconds and vibrate again for 0.2 seconds.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Let's make a slight excursion and have a look at web activities.<br />
                        Web activities allow you to build links between apps. There are two sides to that.
                    </aside>
                </section>

                <section>
                    TODO: add a picture<br />
                    Use another apps functionality
                    <aside class="notes">
                        One side is when you want to reuse a different apps functionality.<br />
                        Examples might be sharing something, or taking a picture - you want to offer the functionality to the user of the app, but don't want to implement it all yourself, so you call a web activity.<br />
                        Sharing might offer a selection of Twitter, Facebook or Google Plus, while take a picture will offer you the Camera or the Gallery.
                    </aside>
                </section>

                <section>
                    TODO: add a picture<br />
                    Offer functionality
                    <aside class="notes">
                        The other side is if you want to offer functionality from your app, so that other apps can take advantage of it.<br />
                        What you can do is register your app for existing activities, or you can create your own activities. When creating your own activity, it's considered best practice to prefix it with your URL/Domain, to avoid namespace collisions.
                    </aside>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Sharing an Image</h2>
                    <pre><code data-trim>
var share = new MozActivity({
    name: "share",
    data: {
        type: "image/*",
        number: 1,
        blobs: [new Blob($('#imgToShare')[0], {type: "text/png"})]
    }
});

share.onsuccess = function() {
    // Do stuff
};
share.onerror = function () { // handle error };
                    </code></pre>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Let's take a closer look at the first scenario first.<br />
                        Basically all we have to do is instantiate a new object, and tell it what kind of activity we want to execute.<br />
                        As soon as that object is instantiated the user will see the interface to choose what he wants to do.
                    </aside>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Offering an Activity</h2>
                    <pre><code data-trim>
"pick": {
    "href": "./pick.html",
    "disposition": "inline",
    "filters": {
        "type": ["image/*","image/jpeg","image/png"]
    },
    "returnValue": true
}
                    </code></pre>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        The alternative, if our app wants to offer functionality, needs two steps - we need to register the activity and handle it.<br />
                        Registering the app happens in the app manifest, where we add Objects that configure it.<br />
                        <em>pick</em> is the name of the activity in this case, and additionally we define the href, which is the page that should be opened when the activity is called. The <em>disposition</em> has two options, either inline or window<br />
                        <strong>TODO: see if there's a difference</strong>
                        returnValue is a boolean, stating if the call will return a value or not... TODO: look into in more detail<br />
                        Finally, filters specify what image types this activity should be offered for. This can be easy like in this example, but can also have things like ranges with a minimum and maximum, a pattern, and more.

    var options = request.source;
    if ("pick" === options.name) {
        //TODO: add code

        if (isOk) {
            request.postResult();
            request.postError();

                        <strong>Things to note:</strong><br />

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Let's expand on that a bit:<br />
                        There's some more not really interesting data in here, including data about you, as well as an icon.<br />
                        You can add a bunch of different icons in different sizes if you want, and for Firefox OS apps there are some guidelines to what icons should look like.<br />
                        There's also a fullscreen flag, which is specific to FirefoxOS, and allows you to say if the app should be launched in fullscreen mode or not.
                        Firefox Marketplace requires the developer name to be included.

                        We can add translations for pretty much all this metadata.<br />
                        We specify the default_locale property, saying all this stuff is English, and then have a locales object, with an object for each language, where we can overwrite the fields above.<br />
                        This does not have anything to do with the app's language itself, only the metadata in this manifest file.<br />
                        You can overwrite almost all the fields in it though, with very few exceptions.

                        I'm not the expert on this, but in general messages allow you to catch system events and react to them. The whole thing is a two step process - you register for the event here in the manifest and also have to register the actual callback function in the JavaScript code.<br />
                        This can be useful combined with the Alarm API as a 'local notification' system.

                        So now we've got our manifest put together! Anything else we need to know?<br />
                        Well one thing is that manifests need to be served with a content-type of 'application/x-web-app-manifest+json', so that they're recognized and parsed. Github does this automatically for files with a <em>.webapp</em> ending, you can output the content type easily on your own server as well.<br />
                        Then, the manifest file has to be hosted at the same origin as your app. Seems obvious too, but is probably worth mentioning. Also, paths to icons and so on should be absolute.<br />
                        There are manifest validators available, and there's also a service with an API that allows you to validate manifests if you happen to need something like that.

                        First off, notice that it's called <em>Firefox</em> Marketplace and not <em>Firefox OS</em> Marketplace.<br />
                        That's because it's not meant only for Firefox OS, you can submit normal web apps, which can be installed through Firefox (like the Chrome Web Store), but also on Firefox on Android, a first step towards mobile apps. And of course you can allow them to be installed on Firefox OS.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Submitting an app to the Firefox Marketplace works two ways, depending on the type of app you're trying to submit. You'll need to log in with a Persona account and then you'll see a screen where you can select for what device(s) your app is. If you're submitting a hosted web app you can simply enter the URL to your manifest file, and if you want to submit a packaged app you can upload the zip file for it.<br />
                        The site validates the manifest, and in the case of packaged apps does some security checks on the code as well (CSP). Once those pass you can go to the next step where you can enter details about your app, things like categories, a privacy policy, ...

                        So there are guidelines to what's allowed in the store and what isn't, and there's a team that reviews all the submissions. Reviews are meant to be fair, and be mostly about security checks and providing feedback to developers.<br />
                        Reviews are not QA! Reviewers will install the app and click around a bit and make sure the app seems to work and isn't misleading.<br />
                        Once your app passes the review it'll show up on the marketplace.
