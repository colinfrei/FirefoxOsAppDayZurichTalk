                        First a tiny bit about me: I work as a web developer at Liip, coding in PHP and JavaScript. I've been involved with the Mozilla Community for about a year, mostly because I'd heard about FirefoxOS, and I've been playing around with different parts of it ever since.<br />
                        I'm definitely not an expert on everything I'm going to talk about, but I have spent too much time playing around and reading specs on a bunch of this stuff.

                        There's a whole bunch of APIs that have come up, this isn't a complete list either. Some are already very widespread, think Geolocation, others not at all. I've never seen WebBluetooth in the wild yet for example, but it sounds like fun. WebNFC is on the list of things to come.<br />
                        All the apps on the FirefoxOS phones are written using these APIs, and so they let you do most things a phone can. You could theoretically write your own dialer using the WebTelephony app for example.<br />
                        We'll look at a few fun ones to give you some ideas of how you can extend your existing app easily.

                        Ambient Light is a w3c working draft. It adds an event on the window object, which gets called with the lux value the ambient light sensor measured.<br />
                        This is really straightforward, but allows cool things like allowing you to change the style and the contrast of your site/app based on the ambient light.

                        This one used to be called <em>WebVibrator</em>, that was changed to <em>Vibration API</em> after all the bad jokes had been made too many times.<br />
                        The Vibration API is simple as well, it allows you to call a function on the navigator object and either pass it a length it should vibrate (in milliseconds) or an array, where it'll switch between vibrating and not vibrating. So in the bottom example, it'd vibrate for 0.2 seconds, pause for 0.1 seconds and vibrate again for 0.2 seconds.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Push notification require a bit more code, since you need a backend to it, but they're still fairly easy. You simplyregister a pushnotification, and the browser will return an endpointUrl, which is on a third-party server. You send that URL to your backend server, and whenever you want to send a push notification to the device, you can PUT to that endpointURL.<br />
                        That will cause the notification to be pushed to the device, which will broadcast a message, and that message can cause other things to happen, like you notifying the user. We'll see how messages are dealt with in more detail later on.

                        Payments have a bunch of parts, having to do with authentication, identification, payment processing and so on. It's all specificed in a set of specifications under the name PaySwarm. I haven't played around with it much, but my understanding is that you wrap all the payment information into  a so called Web Token, and the payment itself is simply a call to mozPay(), passing in that token and returning the result.

                        Next up: web activities.<br />
                        Web activities are similiar to <strong>Web Intents</strong>, they allow you to build links between apps. There are two sides to that.
                    </aside>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Two sides</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use another app's functionality</li>
                        <li>Offer functionality</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        One side is when you want to reuse a different apps functionality.<br />
                        Examples might be sharing something, or taking a picture - you want to offer the functionality to the user of the app, but don't want to implement it all yourself, so you call a web activity.<br />
                        Sharing might offer a selection of Twitter, Facebook or Google Plus, while take a picture will offer you the Camera or the Gallery.<br />
                        The other side is if you want to offer functionality from your app, so that other apps can take advantage of it.<br />
                        What you can do is register your app for existing activities, or you can create your own activities. When creating your own activity, it's considered best practice to prefix it with your URL/Domain, to avoid namespace collisions.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Let's take a closer look at the first scenario first.<br />
                        Basically all we have to do is instantiate a new object, and tell it what kind of activity we want to execute.<br />
                        As soon as that object is instantiated the user will see the interface to choose what he wants to do.

                    <pre><code data-trim>
"pick": {
    "href": "./pick.html",
    "disposition": "inline",
    "filters": {
        "type": ["image/*","image/jpeg","image/png"]
    },
    "returnValue": true
}
                    </code></pre>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        The alternative, if our app wants to offer functionality, needs two steps - we need to register the activity and handle it.<br />
                        Registering the app happens in the app manifest, where we add Objects that configure it.<br />
                        <em>pick</em> is the name of the activity in this case, and additionally we define the href, which is the page that should be opened when the activity is called. The <em>disposition</em> has two options, either inline or window<br />
                        returnValue is a boolean, stating if the call will return a value or not.<br />
                        Finally, filters specify what image types this activity should be offered for. This can be easy like in this example, but can also have things like ranges with a minimum and maximum, a pattern, and more.

                        Let's expand on that a bit:<br />
                        There's some more not really interesting data in here, including data about you, as well as an icon.<br />
                        You can add a bunch of different icons in different sizes if you want, and for Firefox OS apps there are some guidelines to what icons should look like.<br />
                        If you want to submit your app to the marketplace you'll need a 128x128 icon
                        There's also a fullscreen flag, which is specific to FirefoxOS, and allows you to say if the app should be launched in fullscreen mode or not.
                        Firefox Marketplace requires the developer name to be included.

                        We specify the default_locale property, saying all this stuff is English, and then have a locales object, with an object for each language, where we can overwrite the fields above.<br />

                        I'm not the expert on this, but in general messages allow you to catch system events and react to them. The whole thing is a two step process - you register for the event here in the manifest and also have to register the actual callback function in the JavaScript code.<br />
                        This can be useful combined with the Alarm API as a 'local notification' system.

                        <p>Types are important - they basically decide what APIs an app has access to. There are three permission types for Firefox OS: web, privileged and certified.<br />
                        Web apps have the leat permission, but can be distributed in the easiest way.<br />
                        Privileged apps have access to some APIs that can be "misused", so the code of these apps is reviewed to make sure it doesn't do anything stupid. One example is the Contacts API, which allows you to read the content of your phonebook.<br />
                        Certified apps have access to all the APIs, so these are extremely limited. This includes things like being allowed to register to handle phone calls. These apps are reviewed for security, and digitally signed. Most apps that are certified are probably preloaded apps.

                        In addition to permission types there's what I call app types. These differentiate between apps that are hosted on the web and use appcache and stuff to work offline, and apps that are packaged as a zip file and installed directly on the phone.<br />
                        The important distinction here is between privileged as a permission type and packaged as an app type. I spent about half a day trying to figure out why I didn't have permission to use an API, because I thought packaged automatically meant privileged, which it doesn't.

                        So now we've got our manifest put together! Anything else we need to know?<br />
                        Well one thing is that manifests need to be served with a content-type of 'application/x-web-app-manifest+json', so that they're recognized and parsed. Github does this automatically for files with a <em>.webapp</em> ending, you can output the content type easily on your own server as well.<br />
                        Then, the manifest file has to be hosted at the same origin as your app. Seems obvious too, but is probably worth mentioning. Also, paths to icons and so on should be absolute.<br />
                        There are manifest validators available, and there's also a service with an API that allows you to validate manifests if you happen to need something like that.

                        Submitting an app to the Firefox Marketplace works two ways, depending on the type of app you're trying to submit. You'll need to log in with a Persona account and then you'll see a screen where you can select for what device(s) your app is. If you're submitting a hosted web app you can simply enter the URL to your manifest file, and if you want to submit a packaged app you can upload the zip file for it.<br />
                        The site validates the manifest, and in the case of packaged apps does some security checks on the code as well (CSP). Once those pass you can go to the next step where you can enter details about your app, things like categories, a privacy policy, ...

                        So there are guidelines to what's allowed in the store and what isn't, and there's a team that reviews all the submissions. Reviews are meant to be fair, and be mostly about security checks and providing feedback to developers.<br />
                        Reviews are not QA! Reviewers will install the app and click around a bit and make sure the app seems to work and isn't misleading.<br />
                        Once your app passes the review it'll show up on the marketplace.
